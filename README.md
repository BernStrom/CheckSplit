CheckSplit is an app that makes dividing a bill among friends while eating out a breeze.

The app features a simple interface with a basic layout of sections, two of which are where it requires the user input; the total amount of the bill & the number of people to be divided and the amount of tips in percentage.

As for the in-app currency, it is set to display according to the locale settings of the user device with a fallback default to **$** (USD); i.e: Device region set to **United Kingdom** will display the in-app currency in **￡** (GBP).

## Trying it yourself

CheckSplit is written using Xcode 13.2 and Swift 5.0. To try it out, you can clone this project and build it immediately by opening `CheckSplit.xcodeproj`.

As far as I know the app feature is complete, but there are likely to be errors all over the place at least to begin with – if you hit any problems, either building or running the app, please let me know.

## Important notes on usage

Keep in mind that this app is simply a project designed and built for my own personal educational purposes only. The sole purpose for this app project was to gain practical experience in building an app in iOS with Swift & SwiftUI. The state of this app was never meant to be production-ready, published onto the App Store, or to be monetized in any way, shape, or form.

If you wish to do any of the above, you will have to make some changes to the app before submitting to the App Store for approval. Please keep in mind of any potential violation of third-party license, such as the usage of SF Symbols and/or Emoji of the app icon.
